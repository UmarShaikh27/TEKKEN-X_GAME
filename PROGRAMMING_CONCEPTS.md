# Core Programming Concepts in TEKKEN-X

This document outlines the advanced programming concepts and software engineering principles implemented in the TEKKEN-X fighting game project.

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts

### 1. Inheritance
- Base class `Player` serves as the foundation for all character classes
- Character classes (Bluewoman, Redman, Kakashi, etc.) inherit from the base class
- Demonstrates proper use of class hierarchies and code reuse

### 2. Polymorphism
- Virtual functions in the `Player` class (`flip()`, `deletePlayer()`)
- Runtime polymorphism through character selection system
- Different characters behave uniquely while sharing common interfaces

### 3. Encapsulation
- Private member variables in classes (`Playerstates`)
- Public interfaces for interaction
- Protected class data through proper access modifiers

### 4. Abstraction
- Complex game mechanics simplified through clear interfaces
- Character states abstracted into the `Playerstates` structure
- Game loop abstraction in the `Game` class

## Game Development Concepts

### 1. Game Loop Architecture
- Implements a professional game loop pattern
- Handles input, updates game state, and renders frames
- Maintains consistent game timing using the `Timer` class

### 2. State Management
- Character state management (walking, attacking, hit states)
- Game state transitions (menu → character selection → gameplay → victory)
- Efficient state tracking using enumerated states

### 3. Collision Detection
- Hit detection between characters
- Boundary checking for screen limits
- Distance-based attack impact detection

## Software Engineering Principles

### 1. SOLID Principles
- Single Responsibility Principle: Each class has a focused purpose
- Open/Closed Principle: New characters can be added without modifying existing code
- Interface Segregation: Clear separation of concerns in class interfaces

### 2. Memory Management
- Proper allocation and deallocation of resources
- Smart handling of SDL textures and surfaces
- Clean shutdown sequence preventing memory leaks

### 3. Design Patterns
- Factory Pattern: Character creation system
- State Pattern: Character animation states
- Observer Pattern: Event handling system

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Graphics Programming
- SDL2 integration for rendering
- Sprite sheet management
- Animation system implementation

### 2. Audio Programming
- Sound effect management
- Background music implementation
- Audio state management

### 3. Input Handling
- Multi-player input processing
- Event-driven architecture
- Keyboard state management

## Build System and Development Tools

### 1. Make System
- Professional Makefile configuration
- Dependency management
- Cross-platform compilation support

### 2. Version Control
- Git-based source control
- .gitignore configuration
- Project structure organization

### 3. Development Environment
- VS Code integration
- Build task configuration
- Debug configuration setup

## Performance Considerations

### 1. Resource Management
- Efficient texture loading and unloading
- Memory footprint optimization
- Resource pooling for frequently used assets

### 2. Optimization Techniques
- Sprite batching for efficient rendering
- Collision optimization using spatial partitioning
- Frame rate management and synchronization

## Project Organization

### 1. Code Structure
- Modular design with clear separation of concerns
- Header files for interface definitions
- Implementation files for detailed logic

### 2. Asset Management
- Organized directory structure
- Resource loading system
- Asset pipeline management
